# My Experience with SNHU's Computer Science Program
My time here at Southern New Hampshire University has given my the basics in many areas of Software Development and Engineering.
I have learned:
   * New coding languages
   * Create and Use databases with SQL
   * Creating graphical objects
   * Create mobile applications
   * Utilize software testing
   * Create/Maintain Secure Code
   * Reverse engineer software   
   
However, as important (if not more important) are the soft-skills that I have learned or improved during this program, such as:
   * Working with a team
   * Communication between coworkers, as well as management, stakeholders and clients.
   * Time Management (especially as I maintained full-time employement throughout this program)
   * How to apply my personal best at whatever task I am working on.
   * How to focus on a single task without loosing where this task fits with the whole or the purpose of the task itself.
   

# Capstone Project: Temperature and Humidity Monitor
This project was originally created as a weather station during the Emerging Systems Architecture and Technologies coarse.  This weather station uses a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ computer board along with a GrovePi+ board with various LEDs and Sensors to obtain the temperature and Humidity readings, every 30 minutes in daylight conditions.  I modified this program to save readings to a database table and be able to access the readings via a webpage: [http://christina-davidson.com](http://christina-davidson.com).  

## Informal Code Review
I completed a [code review](http://christina-davidson.com/codereview.html) on the original python code that was submitted in the corresponding class. 

## Artifact Enhancements
### Software Design and Engineering
The portion of the capstone project that I believe closly ties to this category is the [python code](http://christina-davidson.com/pythoncode.html) used to run the monitor.  My enhancements focused on bringing code up to python coding standards where possible, as well as having the readings save to a database table instead of a json file.
### Database
I created a database with a table to hold the necessary values: date and time, temperature and humidity.  
### Algorithm and Data Structures
I created a web server on my raspberry pi, as well as creating the webpage file [http://christina-davidson.com](http://christina-davidson.com) to display the database information obtained by the monitor.  The code used to create the webpage can be found at: [http://christina-davidson.com/htmlcode.html](http://christina-davidson.com/htmlcode.html)

# My Experience with SNHU's Computer Science Program


# Capstone Project: Temperature and Humidity Monitor
This project was originally created as a weather station during the Emerging Systems Architecture and Technologies coarse.  This weather station uses a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ computer board along with a GrovePi+ board with various LEDs and Sensors to obtain the temperature and Humidity readings, every 30 minutes in daylight conditions.  I modified this program to save readings to a database table and be able to access the readings via a webpage.
